# TF2 configuration files

Because I switch between OS X and Windows a lot I wanted to have my config files stashed somewhere save.
The benefit of having the changes is also a very good reason to put them on here.

As you might notice the scripts I have are basically only configured for medic and in a general way in the `autoexec.cfg`.

I don't use my middle mouse for speech so I put the melee on there. Scroll up always goes to medigun and down goes to secondary.
Q switches between medigun and secondary depending on which is active.

It contains:

* Loadout calls for switching
* Autohealing on (disable with "F")
* Non-blocking movement (left, left+right = right)
* Medic radar on key (shift + switch to anything other than medigun)
* Randomized speech to mask uber (shift)
* Viewmodel toggling (capslock)
